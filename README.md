# ElonDogeListener
TLDR; A simple python script which buys Doge when Elon Musk tweets about it

You've probably heard news about Dogecoin surging in the past few weeks and especially when Elon Musk has tweeted any keyword relating to the Crypto coin. So I decided to jump on the hype train and earn a little bit of money through the crypto coin, but I didn't want to look at his twitter all day and wait for him to tweet about it so I created a script which will do that for me! I also wanted a notification to my phone when I have bought the crypto coin so I used the Push bullet api to do exactly that.

The script will not work out of the box as you need to use your own said keys for both twitter, pusbullet and Binance.
